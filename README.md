# SOC Core Concepts

This repository documents core cybersecurity and networking concepts required for a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst.

Each concept is broken down into a focused micro-task and explained using:
- Clear written explanations
- A single visual information diagram
- Direct relevance to SOC concepts

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate foundational understanding, system-level thinking, and the ability to connect theory with real SOC operations.

## Structure

Each folder in this repository represents one core concept and contains:
- One README.md explaining the concept in simple, accurate terms
- One visual diagram illustrating how the concept works
- A short section explaining why the concept matters in a SOC environment

## Scope

The concepts covered here directly support:
- SIEM log ingestion and analysis
- Windows and network authentication monitoring
- Incident investigation and triage
- Understanding how security events are generated and collected

This repository is maintained alongside a hands-on SOC home lab to reinforce practical understanding and operational context.
